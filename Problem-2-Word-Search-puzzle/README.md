## Word Search Puzzle
### Rules of the game
The game Word Search Puzzle presents a grid of seemingly random letters and a set of words. The goal is to find and mark all the words hidden with a grid of letters, along straight lines in three directions:

horizontal: from left to right
vertical: from top to bottom
diagonal: from upper left to bottom right
You are going to design a program that generates the letter grid for the word search puzzle game. In particular, the program is generating a triangular puzzle.

You can find the word "eleven" in the diagonal direction, the word "four" in the vertical direction and "seven" in the horizontal direction.
